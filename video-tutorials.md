## How to create your first bot

Becoming a WhatABot Explorer is a fairly straight forward process:

```bash
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RWpi5nQPqI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
