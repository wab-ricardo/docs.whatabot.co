**Introduction to AI**

When it comes to complex tasks, the AI bots rely on an action sequence to establish the primary goal of the user with the help of memory of the past user responses and the mapping of requests from users to valid responses stored in the response repository. These intelligent bots may either map responses based on similar  history information of  different user, or the same, and create intelligent responses based on the keywords in the users request.

Simply put, a chatbot’s receives input data, interprets it, and translates it into a relevant output value. Upon receiving the input data, it must analyze and contextualize to determine the appropriate “reaction” to whatever prompt it has received.

Buy incorporating specific logic to understand specific Entities within phrases entered by the user. An example could be that entered phrase is as follows,- “I would like to book a flight to California” The AI set to understand “flight” and or "California", "Cal? the Entities. = The user is looking to travel and links you to your clients travel website with California set as destination.

Another, example could be, User- “I am hungry” = AI- “What do you want to eat”, User responds with “Pizza”= linking you to a pizza shop, Or “Chinese” = linking you with a list of local Chinese restaurants. Also, time, directions can be transferred with AI calling an Uber service to pick you up at point A and leave you at point B at 4:30pm. The AI will be able to understand the time and directions, to pass through the system for the service provider to get your Uber there on time.

This gives you the ability to fine tune specific data points to understand more difficult operations. Using different variables to guide the system in a direction dependent on said variables and it will learn. 

So lets go ahead and click on the AI button on the left hand side



Now click on the Intents tab

**Intents**

Define intents – An Intent is an action or activity that a bot can understand from what a user says Therefore, it is important to provide enough samples of phrases that specifically represents the intent. With this information it is possible to train the bot so that it understands the user. The more phrases you use \(up to 100\) The more parameters THE Bot will have to act out the desired needs. Click on intent tab and a window will appear with the necessary fields to be completed accordingly for your model.
