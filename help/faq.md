# FAQ

## How do we count messages?

As we have message-based plans, it is important for our customers to clearly understand how we count messages.  Let's get started.  First, a conversation between a bot and a person \(parties\) is made of messages.  A message can have multiple bubbles.  Each bubble represents a single sent message.  We count a message as one or more conversation bubbles sent by a party before the other party responds.  We count messages from both parties.

## What channels are supported?

We currently support WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, web  chat and SMS \(selected countries\).   We plan to add popular channels such as Telegram and Wechat.
