## How to request a WABA?

This process is done thru GupShup.io.  To start the process, please click on option Channels/WhatsApp.  Then click on  Create a Line.  You will need the following information:

* Provide the ID number of your Facebook Business verified account. [ Learn how to verify your business on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).
* Provide the phone number you want to have your WABA associated to.  This number must not be registered to a WhatsApp account.  If so, please close the account related to that number and wait for 7 days to make it usable in a WABA.
* Provide contact information \(e-mail address, phone number, legal name, address, city, postal code, and type of business\)
* Once we receive the Facebook Business ID, the valid phone number, and the contact information, we will request your WABA to WhatsApp.  During the process we will send a link to approve GupShup to request your WABA in your name. This will be sent via SMS. 
* This might take between 2 to 5 working days, but it usually is approved within 2 working days.
* When approved, the last step will be to receive a verification code that WhatsApp sends to the phone number via WhatsApp.  This must be coordinated as we need to enter that code in our system before it expires. 

After the WABA has been approved, it will be available in Chat-Bots within 1 hour under the left menu Channels/WhatsApp Lines.
